Deploying (GITHUB, HEROKU, RSYNC)

Here are some nice and easy ways to deploy your Octopress blog.


###GitHub Pages

Hosting your blog with GitHub's <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Pages service </a> is free and allows custom domains. To deploy you simply push your repository to GitHub. This is a great way to host a personal blog, or even a multi-author blog, where contributions can be handled with pull requests and commit access.

###Heroku

Like GitHub Pages, Heroku is also free, allows custom domains, and uses a git based deployment workflow. Heroku is a bit simpler to use and your blog repository remains private.
